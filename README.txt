Overview

This Jupyter Notebook implements a sophisticated Music Recommendation System designed to suggest similar songs to users based on various musical features and user preferences. It leverages machine learning techniques and data normalization to predict and recommend songs that share similarities with user inputs.

Features
Data Cleaning: Removal of irrelevant data and handling missing values to improve the model's accuracy.
Feature Extraction: Analysis and selection of key musical features that influence song similarity.
Data Normalization: Using StandardScaler from scikit-learn to standardize the feature set for optimal performance.
Recommendation Algorithm: A custom algorithm that matches songs based on feature similarities.

Requirements
This system requires the following Python libraries:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn

Usage
To use the music recommendation system, follow these steps:

Data Preparation: Ensure your dataset is in the correct format. The dataset should include features such as genre, tempo, and others that are crucial for the recommendation algorithm.

Run the Notebook: Execute all cells in the notebook to process the data, train the model, and prepare the recommendation system.

Make Song Recommendations:

When prompted, input the name of a song.
The system will output a list of songs that are similar based on the trained model.
Data
The system utilizes a dataset that should include detailed musical features. Make sure the dataset is accessible to the notebook and properly formatted with the necessary features.

Contributing
Feel free to make changes or improvements to the Music Recommendation System. You can modify the code directly in the Jupyter Notebook. If you find a bug or have a feature request, consider sharing it with the community or the original creators of the notebook.
